Hello world,

Just a graduating master student who has no finals and is super bored XD

I wanted to take this course on coursera about R programming

But the prerequisite course is data scientisits' toolbox

And they want you to have a github account to do projects 

So here I am

(I can't program and I don't like it, but good luck to me :D)
